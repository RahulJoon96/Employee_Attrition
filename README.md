# Employee_Attrition

Employees are the backbone of the organisation. Organisation's performance is heavily based on the quality of the employees.

Challenges that an organisation has to face due to employee attrition are -

1. Expensive in terms of both money and time to train new employees
2. Loss of experienced employees
3. Impact in productivity
4. Impact profit

Business questions to brainstorm - 
1. What factors are contributing more to employee attrition ?
2. What type of factors should the company address in order to retain their employees ?

Keeping in mind the project requirements, here in this project, we will try to address the above mentioned questions. 
With the help of pyspark, We will first fetch the data of employee attrition in the databricks, stored in the csv format, from AWS S3 bucket by creating the Access key and Secret key. Then we will create a dataframe. Later, with the help of sql queries, we will analyze the below mentioned criterias and will try to find a solution

1.   Agewise_Analysis
2.   DepartmentWise _Analysis
3.   GenderWise _Analysis
4.   JobRoleWise _Analysis
5.   Monthly_Income Based Analysis
